with Sxx = 1058, Syy = 198.76 and Sxy = −363.63. Using the simple linear regression model
Yi = β0 + β1xi +    ; i = 1, 2,..., 25
where the  are independent and normally distributed with zero means and equal variances σ2, obtain the least squares estimates of β0 and β1. Carry out a lack-of-fit test to determine the adequacy of the simple linear regression model at the 5% level of significance. Interpret the results.
